# First time to build a Solana Dapp 

We inspired by the doge who named Lobster and made this website. We were trying to provide a farming coin named LOBEE.
It's our first time get into rust and solana, and its quite challenging.

## Quick Start

The following dependencies are required to build and run this example,
depending on your OS, they may already be installed:

```bash
$ node --version
$ npm --version
$ docker -v
$ wget --version
$ rustup --version
$ rustc --version
$ cargo --version
```

To install all the dependencies 

```
cd frontend
npm install
```

To deploye the smart contract
```
npm run build_contract
```
